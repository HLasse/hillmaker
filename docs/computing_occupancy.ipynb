In our Short Stay Unit (SSU) example, we have been using an *analysis date range* of 2024-01-02 through 2024-09-30. Let's use hourly time bins. This leads to 6552 hourly datetime bins as shown below.

    "By default, whatever you specify for the `bin_size_minutes` parameter (default is 60 minutes) is the resolution at which the `bydatetime` table is created. However, if for some reason you want to create (and save) a version of the `bydatetime` table with smaller time bin sizes, you can do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a `highres_bin_size_minutes` parameter that you can set to a smaller value than `bin_size_minutes` if you would like to compute occupancy in the bydatetime table at a finer resolution but still want to report aggregate statistics using `bin_size_minutes`. For example, you could set `highres_bin_size_minutes=10` but keep `bin_size_minutes=60`. Using the default settings in hillmaker (see next section), this will **NOT** affect the aggregate statistics. However, it allows you to create a separate version of the bydatetime table at this higher resolution for further analysis. In order to save the high resolution version, set `keep_highres_bydatetime=True`.\n",

    "## The `edge_bins` parameter and its impact on occupancy calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Since hillmaker's earliest days, it has always been possible to treat the arrival and departure bins in two different ways. The default behavior, `edge_bins=1`, uses the method described in this notebook in which a fractional occupancy contribution is computed based on the fraction of time the entity was in the system during the arrival and departure bins. However, if you really want to give the \"full credit\" for occupancy during the arrival and departure bins (i.e. use a value of $1.0$ instead of the fraction of the bin occupied, you can set `edge_bins=2`.\n",

Originally the 'develop' branch was going to be for the OO design version. However, after thinking about it
and talking with JW, I think this branch will now focus on creating a solid guts version, non OO, that can
be used from a python script or interactively. It will just focus on the base computations, a text in and text out IO
model, and illustration of various use cases via IPython notebooks. This will set the foundation for the OO
version that will come next.

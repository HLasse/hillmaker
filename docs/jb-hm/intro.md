# Welcome to the hillmaker docs

hillmaker is a Python package that computes time of day and day of week specific
occupancy statistics from transaction data containing arrival and departure
timestamps. Typical use is for capacity planning problems in places like
hospital emergency departments, surgical recovery rooms or any system in which
entities arrive, occupy capacity for some amount of time, and then depart. hillmaker
gets its name from the hill-like nature of plots based on temporal occupancy
statistics.

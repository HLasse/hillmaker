The history of hillmaker
------------------------

Way back in 1985 I was an undergraduate student studying industrial and
operations engineering and landed a summer internship with a local hospital. My
very first project involved analysis of bed capacity and staffing in the
hospital's `endoscopy <>`_ unit. Relevant questions included:

-


From a stack of paper records I entered
hundreds of rows of data into Lotus 1-2-3. Each row was a patient and for
each patient I entered their arrival and discharge times into and out of the
endoscopy suite as well as the type of endoscopy procedure.



It has been used by operations analysts, management engineers
and other such analytical folk. A journal publication describing its use in
the healthcare industry is:

Capacity Planning Application, *International Journal of Information
Technology and Decision Making*, 1, 4 (December) 707-729.
